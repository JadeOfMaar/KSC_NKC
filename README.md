# KSC NKC
## North-hop Kerman Corporation
An alternate KSC Expansion. Focuses on aircraft and boats, not rockets. It's named North-hop with the namesake of the IRL space agency, Northrup Grumman Corporation. The NKC primarily adds a polar facing runway and launchpad but also adds other runways, a harbor and interactive KK facilities.

### Features:
* Diverse KK facility modules for a large degree of interactivity with the base.
* 2 water launch points (one is 200m below). ~~If you spawn on the sea floor at the nearer point, not the Dragon's Lair, that's a new KK bug.~~
* Extended runway for super-heavy planes to run on while braking on touchdown.
* Launch from the 4 cardinal directions on the added runways + 2 ramps for STOL planes.
* Harbor does not appear if you use Sigma Dimensions or most of the popular system replacer planet packs. If it does appear, delete the folder `GameData/KSC_NKC/NKCHarbor/`
* Compatible with JNSQ and Beyond Home.
* Compatible with KSC Extended (which, in turn, is not currently compatible with Beyond Home).
